Random Forest Regression for Stock Price Prediction
In this project, I utilized Random Forest Regression to predict stock prices based on historical data. Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that leverages multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and robustness. By aggregating the predictions of numerous decision trees, this method captures complex relationships in the data and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation: Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data, including features such as open price, close price, and volume.
Model Implementation: Applied Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn to model the relationship between historical features and future stock prices.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of Random Forest Regression in handling complex, non-linear relationships and improving stock price prediction accuracy.
